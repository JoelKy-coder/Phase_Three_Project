# Predicting the Condition of Water Wells in Tanzania
## Business Understanding
## Problem Description
Tanzania, with a population of over 57 million, faces significant challenges in providing access to clean and reliable water sources. While numerous water points (wells, boreholes, and pumps) have been established across the country, many are non-functional, in need of repair, or have failed altogether. This situation exacerbates water scarcity, particularly in rural and underserved areas, impacting public health, economic productivity, and overall quality of life.

The Government of Tanzania, in collaboration with NGOs and development partners, is committed to improving water infrastructure. However, limited resources and the vast number of water points make it difficult to prioritize repairs and maintenance. A data-driven approach to predict the condition of water wells can help the government and NGOs identify non-functional or at-risk wells, allocate resources efficiently, and inform future water infrastructure planning.
## OBJECTIVES
The research seeks to meet the following objectives:

1. Analyze the Impact of Age, Technology, and Investment on Water Point Failure
2. Assess the Impact of Socioeconomic and Geographical Factors
3. Develop a Predictive Model for Water Point Failure
## Data Understanding
This research utilized data from DrivenData about waterpoints. The dataset was split into three CSV files:

1. Training set values
2. Training set labels
3. Test set values
The training and test datasets contained similar columns, while the training set labels dataset included one column, which was the focus of the study.
