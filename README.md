## Business Understanding
## Problem Description
Tanzania, with a population of over 57 million, faces significant challenges in providing access to clean and reliable water sources. While numerous water points (wells, boreholes, and pumps) have been established across the country, many are non-functional, in need of repair, or have failed altogether. This situation exacerbates water scarcity, particularly in rural and underserved areas, impacting public health, economic productivity, and overall quality of life.

The Government of Tanzania, in collaboration with NGOs and development partners, is committed to improving water infrastructure. However, limited resources and the vast number of water points make it difficult to prioritize repairs and maintenance. A data-driven approach to predict the condition of water wells can help the government and NGOs identify non-functional or at-risk wells, allocate resources efficiently, and inform future water infrastructure planning.
## OBJECTIVES
The research seeks to meet the following objectives:

1. Analyze the Impact of Age, Technology, and Investment on Water Point Failure
2. Assess the Impact of Socioeconomic and Geographical Factors
3. Develop a Predictive Model for Water Point Failure
## Data Understanding
This research utilized data from DrivenData about waterpoints. The dataset was split into three CSV files:

1. Training set values
2. Training set labels
3. Test set values
   
The training and test datasets contained similar columns, while the training set labels dataset included one column, which was the focus of the study.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of three CSV files:
- `Training set values.csv`: Contains features for training.
- `Training set labels.csv`: Contains the target variable (well status).
- `Test set values.csv`: Contains features for testing.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Examined dataset size, missing data, and unique values.
- Visualized the distribution of well functionality.
- Analyzed correlations between numerical predictors.

## Model Development
- Preprocessed data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Explored various classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
- Used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Final Summary
The analysis conducted on the well data provided several insights into the functionality and status of wells across different regions and under various conditions. Key findings include:

**Model Performance**:
The Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model with tuned hyperparameters showed improved precision scores for non-functional wells, indicating its potential for identifying wells that may soon become non-functional.
The Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) model was also evaluated, but the RFC model was selected as the final model due to its better performance.

**Feature Importance**:
Feature importance analysis revealed the top features influencing the well status, which can guide future data collection and model improvements.

**Funder and Installer Analysis**:
Analysis of wells funded by different organizations (e.g., World Bank, Government of Tanzania) and installed by various entities highlighted the impact of these factors on well functionality.
Visualizations showed the distribution of well statuses by funder and installer, providing insights into which organizations and installers are associated with better well performance.

**Geographical Analysis**:
The functionality of wells was analyzed across different basins, with a focus on Lake Victoria and Ruvuma/Southern Coast basins.
The construction year of wells in the Ruvuma basin was examined, revealing trends in well functionality over time.
Overall, the analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing well functionality and offers actionable insights for improving water access in the region.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis conducted, the following recommendations are proposed to improve well functionality and water access in the region:

**Focus on Key Features**:
Based on the top features identified in the feature importance analysis. This can help in the early identification of wells that are likely to become non-functional early on.

**Targeted Interventions by Funders and Installers**:
Collaborate with funders and installers who have a track record of better well performance. For instance, wells funded by the World Bank and installed by certain entities showed better functionality. Strengthening partnerships with these organizations can lead to improved outcomes.

**Geographical Focus**:
Concentrate efforts on regions with higher rates of non-functional wells. The analysis highlighted specific basins, such as Lake Victoria and Ruvuma/Southern Coast, where targeted interventions could be beneficial.

**Historical Data Utilization**:
Utilized historical data on well construction years to identify trends and plan maintenance schedules. Older wells, particularly those constructed between 1975 and 1990 in the Ruvuma basin, may require more frequent inspections and repairs.

**Enhanced Data Collection**:
Improve data collection processes to capture more detailed information on well characteristics and conditions. This can enhance the accuracy of predictive models and support better decision-making.

**Continuous Model Tuning**:
Regularly update and tune predictive models to incorporate new data and improve their accuracy. This will help maintain the reliability of predictions and ensure timely interventions.

**Community Engagement**:
You can engage with local communities to gather insights and feedback on well-functioning. Community involvement can provide valuable information and foster a sense of ownership, leading to better maintenance and sustainability of wells.

By implementing these recommendations, it is possible to enhance well functionality, ensure sustainable water access, and improve the overall effectiveness of water management initiatives in the region.
